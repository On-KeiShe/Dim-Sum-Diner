# 🥟 Dim Sum Diner

Dim Sum Diner is my **first solo front-end project**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The project is a simple, static webpage showcasing a curated selection of classic Cantonese dim sum dishes. Each item includes an image, an English and Traditional Chinese name, and a short description.

This project was built to practise **core front-end fundamentals** and to gain confidence working independently from idea to completion.

## ✨ Features

- **Image cards** displaying dim sum dishes
- **Language toggle** from English ↔ Traditional Chinese implemented with Javascript
- **State management** using a simple boolean toggle
- **Custom styling** with CSS Grid, box-shadow, and typography

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML** –  structure and content
- **CSS** – layout and styling
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – language toggle logic and DOM manipulation
- **Google Fonts** – typography (Font Family: *Outfit* & *Shizuru*)

## 🌍 Language Toggle

The page includes a button that allows users to toggle between **English** and **Traditional Chinese** dish names.

This feature was built using:
- DOM selection
- event listeners
- a simple boolean state variable
- the `hidden` attribute for accessibility-friendly visibility control

## 🎯 What I Learned

Through this project, I practised:

- Structuring a small project independently from scratch
- Using CSS Grid for layouts
- Managing simple **state** in Javascript
- Using querySelector and querySelectorAll to interact with the DOM
- Separating concerns between HTML CSS, and JS
- Toggling content visibility using the hidden attribute
- Debugging logic issues independently

## 🚧 Future Improvements

This project is intentionally simple, but possible future enhancements could include:

- Persisting language preference with `localStorage`
- Adding category filters (steamed / fried / baked)
- Improving on a responsive layout
- Refactor dish data into a JavaScript object or array
- Adding dish descriptives as an overlay using CSS
- Rebuilding the project using React

## 💭 Final Notes

This project represents my first complete solo buil and an early milestone in my front-end development journey. The focus was on learning, experimenting, and understanding fundamentals rather than perfection. It marks an important step in my journey into front-end development.
